**1. Is the average rating count different for male and female authors?**

```{r}
master_data = read.csv('master_dataset.csv')
```

$$H_0:\mu_M=\mu_F$$

__Test: Independent 2-tailed Z-test to compare mean reader count among the 2 groups.__

```{r}
m = with(master_data,tapply(rating_count, author_sex, mean))
s = with(master_data,tapply(rating_count, author_sex, sd))
n = with(master_data,tapply(rating_count, author_sex, length))
data.frame(m,s,n)
z = (m[1]-m[2])/sqrt(sum(s^2/n))
p = round(2*(pnorm(z)),4) 
data.frame(z,p)
```

Results: Since the p-vale is not less tha 0.05, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
 This means the average rating count of male authors is equal to average rating counts of female authors.
